# Verminator

Verminator is a 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2020 entry made in Unity. It's a classic hack & slash roguelike that has pen & paper RPG inspired graphical style. The player is tasked with clearing out some rats from a taverns cellar, but that turns out to be much harder than what it sounds like.
